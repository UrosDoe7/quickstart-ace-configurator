Choose what type of management zone you want to apply to the entities filtered on the tag `app` and the tag `env`: 
- [Management Zone for legacy application](/Management-Zone/deploy-legacy-mz) => deploy  **management zone** for SI
- (soon) [Management Zone for cloud native application](/Management-Zone/deploy-cloudnative-mz)        => deploy the **management zone** for SI on kubernetes and cloud entities 

# Next Step
